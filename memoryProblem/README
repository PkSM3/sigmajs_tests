=== The memory problem on Sigma JS ===

In this example, we have a global data folder wich contains several graphs in gexf format.
For reading each of them, we must adapt a little the sigma js library and list the gexfs inside the data folder. 
So when we click in one of these, we must see the graph selected, then if i want to view another graph, we must Empty the graph of the sigma instance and rebuild it.
Everytime we use the function empty(), the memory won't be freed. 
It's like the sigma core maintains the certain information about the whole graph that we just erased.
